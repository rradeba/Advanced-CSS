1. Enhancing Web Design with RGBA Colors
Objective:
The aim of this assignment is to explore the use of RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) colors in web design to create visually appealing web pages with enhanced aesthetics and user experience.

Problem Statement:
Modern web design requires more than just solid colors; it demands subtlety, depth, and interactivity. RGBA colors allow designers to add opacity to color values, offering the ability to overlay elements and create more dynamic, layered designs. Your task is to apply RGBA colors to enhance the design of a basic web page, focusing on background colors, text, and interactive elements like buttons and links.

Task 1: Apply RGBA Background Colors
Create a CSS class named .background-fade and apply it to a div element. Use RGBA to set a semi-transparent background color.

Expected Outcome:
A div element with a blue semi-transparent background that allows the webpage's background or other elements behind it to be partially visible.

Task 2: Enhance Text Visibility with RGBA
Enhance the readability of a header element (h1) by adding a text shadow using RGBA for color and opacity, creating a subtle shadow effect.

Expected Outcome:
The header text with a white color that stands out against the background with a soft shadow, improving visibility and text readability.

Task 3: Interactive Buttons with RGBA Hover Effects
Design a button with a solid RGBA background color. Implement a hover effect that changes the button's background color to a different RGBA value.

Expected Outcome:
A button that visually responds to user interaction by changing its background color when hovered over, demonstrating dynamic user feedback.

2. Creating Interactive Web Elements with CSS Animations and Transitions
Objective:
The aim of this assignment is to leverage CSS animations and transitions to enhance the interactivity and visual appeal of web elements. Through practical tasks, students will learn to apply smooth transitions and dynamic animations to buttons, links, and other interactive components on a web page.

Problem Statement:
A static webpage fails to engage users effectively. By incorporating CSS animations and transitions, web developers can create a more engaging and interactive experience. This assignment challenges you to apply CSS animations and transitions to bring life to web elements, improving user engagement and the overall aesthetic of the webpage.

Task 1: Smooth Hover Transition for Links
Create a CSS transition effect for all hyperlink (<a>) elements so that their color smoothly changes when hovered over.

Expected Outcome:
Hyperlinks that change color smoothly upon mouse hover, enhancing the interactive feedback for users.

Task 2: Animated Button on Click
Implement a keyframe animation for a button that slightly increases in size when clicked, giving a visual cue of interaction.

Expected Outcome:
A button that animates to become larger when clicked, providing immediate visual feedback of the interaction.

Task 3: Continuous Rotation Animation for an Icon
Apply a continuous rotation animation to an icon or image, creating a visually captivating element on the page.

Expected Outcome:
An icon or image element that continuously rotates, adding a dynamic and engaging visual effect to the webpage.
